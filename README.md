### Hi there, I'm Sharon ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who dropped out of a PhD in neuro/psychology. I am passionate about building consumer-facing software that encourages community-building and creativity. I am currently working on helping to grow the social network of Nextdoor users.

I have experience in backend development, machine learning, and data science and engineering. I am constantly learning and expanding my skillset.

I am available for freelance/consulting opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me through my GitHub profile or email me at sychen23@gmail.com.
